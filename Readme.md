WHAT DID WE LEARN

~Restricted the amount of API service area exposed in index.ts
~~limited the number of things they could do
~~Restrict access to googlemaps by adding private modifier
~~Limited damage to project by engineers who do what they want if we hadnt limited access and gave them all the toys to play with

~Interface used to limit duplicate code
~~Solution for trying to accomadate classes for addMarker
~~Instead customMap said you want to work with me you gotta have what I need otherwise I aint working with you
~~Implements not necessary but added on later on to catch and locate wherabouts where errors might be coming from and reason
